The issue might stem from the camera's frame rate or handling of resources. Experiment with setting a lower frame rate for the camera.  If this doesn't resolve the issue, consider exploring alternative camera libraries such as react-native-camera for more control over camera parameters.

```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

// ... other code

const takePicture = async () => {
  if (cameraRef.current) {
    try {
      const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync({
        quality: 0.7,
        base64: true, // Use base64 encoding for easier data handling
        exif: false, // optional: disabling EXIF data might reduce overhead.
        // Adding the frameRate setting to address potential resource issues
        frameRate: 15 //Experiment with appropriate frameRate
      });
      // Handle the photo
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error taking picture:', error);
    }
  }
};
```
