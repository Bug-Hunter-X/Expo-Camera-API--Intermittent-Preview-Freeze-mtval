While using Expo's `Camera` API, I encountered an issue where the camera preview would freeze intermittently. This happened inconsistently across different devices and didn't seem tied to any particular action.  The error wasn't logged in the console, making debugging difficult.  The app would remain responsive, but the camera preview would show a static image until it unfroze on its own.
